    "UC Irvine - Energy Efficiency Multi-Output Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a deep dive into the findings from my earlier baseline regression work on the UC Irvine Energy Efficiency dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first project, I compared separate linear regression models (one for heating load, one for cooling load) with a multi-output model trained jointly on both targets. The evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²) were almost identical, but the visualizations told a deeper story:\n",
    "- Heating Load residuals shifted downward, showing increased variability compared to the separate model.\n",
    "- Heating Load predictions shifted upward, suggesting less stability when modeled alongside cooling load.\n",
    "- Cooling Load remained largely unchanged, reinforcing that cooling efficiency is more stable and less affected by joint modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "These differences highlighted an important insight: building designs appear to be optimized more for cooling efficiency than heating efficiency. Cooling load remained steady, while heating load absorbed most of the trade-off when modeled together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these findings, I wanted to separate this analysis into its own project. Here, I expand on the role of multi-output regression — not just as a technique, but as a way to uncover how interdependent targets can reveal hidden trade-offs in building design."
