    "|api.py|Serving / Deployment (CD)|This is the Model Server. It loads the artifacts created by train.py, sets up a web server (using Flask), and defines a single /predict endpoint to receive new data and return a prediction.|\n",
    "|test_api.py|Testing / Monitoring|This is the Quality Check. It simulates a client (e.g., a mobile app or dashboard) sending data to the live API to ensure it responds with a correct HTTP status code and a valid prediction.|"
