    "\n",
    "In simple terms, an API is a digital waiter for a web application. It specifies the methods and data formats that external clients (like a mobile app, another server, or your test_api.py script) can use to request and exchange information with your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "API Usage in Project: Your model is a Python program. To allow other non-Python programs to use your model, you wrap it in an API wrapper built using the Flask framework. When a client sends data to the /predict route, Flask runs your model code and sends the prediction back as a clean JSON response.\n",
